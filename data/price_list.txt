APPLICATION NOTES
1. VERY IMPORTANT LS7000/2 IS DESIGNED TO AUTOMATICALLY FILL OR AUTOMATICALLY EMPTY
A VESSEL. LS7000/2 HAS ONLY ONE RELAY, AND THIS RELAY IS DEDICATED TO THE AUTO FILL OR
AUTO EMPTYING APPLICATION. It will not give two discrete outputs as is needed to turn on two lights.
2. LS7000/2 IS DESIGNED TO WORK IN HOMOGENEOUS LIQUIDS. Liquids that change in conductivity or
applications where various materials may be in the vessel at different times are undesirable applications. If this is the
case, please use two probes.
3. LS7000/2 MUST HAVE A HALAR COATED PROBE IN ELECTRICALLY CONDUCTIVE LIQUIDS. Water
and water based liquids are electrically conductive.
4. LS7000/2 MUST BE GROUNDED TO THE LIQUID FOR BEST REPEATABILITY. If the unit is screwed into
the top of a metal tank, the unit will be properly grounded. If the tank is made of fiberglass, or other non-metallic
material, special grounding provisions may be necessary.
5. MATERIAL STICKING ON PROBE WILL AFFECT SETPOINT REPEATABILITY. If this will be a problem,
please use two probes instead of LS7000/2.
6. FOR CRITICAL FILLING APPLICATIONS, A SEPARATE INDEPENDEDNT HIGH LEVEL SWITCH IS
RECOMMENDED FOR POSITIVE ALARM AND/OR SHUT DOWN. Changes in the liquid composition could
cause the upper set-point to drift. Please be safe by using a back-up level switch for positive shut off in critical
applications.
7. DOES NOT WORK WELL IN DRY MATERIALS!
8. LONGEST PROBE WITH HALAR COATING IS 72” (6 FEET)
FOR PROBES OVER 72”, USE TEFLON SLEEVE.

APPLICATION NOTES
1. Remote mounted LS8000 receiver is normally sold without an enclosure. Enclosures can be purchased as an option.
2. Transmitters for LS8000 come in several sensitivities. The factory normally matches the sensitivity to the application
and probe length. Please specify sensitivity or serial number when ordering replacement transmitters.
3. Transmitter sensitivities are noted in the upper right-hand corner of the transmitter. The designation is as follows:
HI………………………………HIGH
M/H…………………………….MEDIUM HIGH
MED……………………………MEDIUM
LO………………………………LOW
LLLO…………………………...TRIPLE LOW
XLO…………………………….EXTRA LOW
4. Transmitters come in two sizes, one for the standard LS8000 housing (3/4”NPT process connection), and one for the
LS7000 housing (1”NPT process connection). The transmitters for the LS8000 housing we call “small”, and the ones
for the LS 7000 housing we call “big”. The “big” style transmitters have a blue wire connecting the banana plug to the
transmitter.
5. Cable probes and special materials of construction available.

LS8000-HOUSING $100.00
FUSE (½ AMP) $10.00
APPLICATION NOTES
1. With two receiver cards you can get 4 set points in an LS8000/2 system on one probe. As this system can
have a central point of failure (the transmitter), it is good engineering practice to use a separate independent
high level switch for emergency shut-down in critical applications.
2. When using a system with 2 or 4 set points on one probe, please keep in mind that these systems are
designed for homogeneous liquids that do not change in their make-up or conductivity. If these
conditions exist, please consider using 2 separate probes.
3. For multiple points on one probe, the fluid must be grounded to the mounting nipple. Special consideration
should be taken for non-metallic tanks.
4. Applications with water based or electrically conductive liquids must have a Halar coated probe.
5. Material sticking on the probe will affect the repeatability of set points in multiple-point-on-one-probe
applications. If such a condition is expected, please use one probe for each set-point.
6. LONGEST PROBE WITH HALAR IS 72” (6 FEET). FOR PROBES OVER 72”, USE TEFLON
SLEEVE.

FUSE (1/2 AMP) $10.00
APPLICATION NOTES
1. It is always good engineering practice to provide a separate, independent high level alarm
2. THE LT9000 IS DESIGNED TO BE USED IN ELECTRICALLY CONDUCTIVE LIQUIDS
THAT DO NOT LEAVE A RESIDUE ON THE PROBE. A wet electrically conductive coating will
give an indication of level at the highest point that there is a continuous coating from the surface of the
fluid.
3. The LT9000 will give a varying output, if the conductivity of the material changes.
4. For proper operation, the LT9000 must be grounded to the fluid. In non-metallic tanks, extra grounding
provisions may be necessary.
5. LONGEST PROBE WITH HALAR IS 72” (6 FEET). FOR PROBES OVER 72”, USE TEFLON
SLEEVE.
6. For high temperatures or harsh acids, please check with the factory to see if the epoxy will be compatible
with the application.
