A wet electrically conductive coating will give an indication of level at the highest point that there is a continuous coating from the surface of the fluid. -5 The LT 9000 will give a varying output, if the conductivity of the material changes. -5 For proper operation, the LT 9000 must be grounded to the fluid. In non-metallic tanks, extra grounding provisions may be necessary. It is good engineering practice to provide a separate independent high-level alarm in critical applications, rather than using a set point based on the 4-20mA output. -5",,NPT,"1"""
