VERY IMPORTANT LS 7000/2 IS DESIGNED TO AUTOMATICALLY FILL OR AUTOMATICALLY EMPTY A VESSEL. LS 7000/2 HAS ONLY ONE RELAY, AND THIS RELAY IS DEDICATED TO THE AUTO FILL OR AUTO EMPTYING APPLICATION. It will not give two discrete outputs as is needed to turn on two lights.
2. LS 7000/2 IS DESIGNED TO WORK IN HOMOGENEOUS LIQUIDS. Liquids that change in conductivity or applications where various materials may be in the vessel at different times are undesirable applications. If this is the case, please use two probes.
3. LS 7000/2 MUST HAVE A HALAR COATED PROBE IN ELECTRICALLY CONDUCTIVE LIQUIDS. Water and water based liquids are electrically conductive.
4. LS 7000/2 MUST BE GROUNDED TO THE LIQUID FOR BEST REPEATABILITY. If the unit is screwed into the top of a metal tank, the unit will be properly grounded. If the tank is made of fiberglass, or other non-metallic material, special grounding provisions may be necessary.
5. MATERIAL STICKING ON PROBE WILL AFFECT SETPOINT REPEATABILITY. If this will be a problem, please use two probes instead of LS 7000/2.
6. FOR CRITICAL FILLING APPLICATIONS, A SEPARATE INDEPENDEDNT HIGH LEVEL SWITCH IS RECOMMENDED FOR POSITIVE ALARM AND/OR SHUT DOWN. Changes in the liquid composition could cause the upper set-point to drift. Please be safe by using a back-up level switch for positive shut off in critical applications.

2. Transmitters for LS 8000 come in several sensitivities. The factory normally matches the sensitivity to the application and probe length. Please specify sensitivity or serial number when ordering replacement transmitters.
3. Transmitter sensitivities are noted in the upper right-hand corner of the transmitter. The designation is as follows:
HI....................................HIGH
M/H..................................MEDIUM HIGH
MED.................................MEDIUM
LO....................................LOW
LLLO.................................TRIPLE LOW
XLO..................................EXTRA LOW
4. Transmitters come in two sizes, one for the standard LS 8000 housing (3/4""NPT process connection), and one for the LS7000 housing (1""NPT process connection). The transmitters for the LS 8000 housing we call ""small"", and the ones for the LS 7000 housing we call ""big"". The ""big"" style transmitters have a blue wire connecting the banana plug to the transmitter.

With two receiver cards you can get 4 set points in an LS 8000/2 system on one probe. As this system can have a central point of failure (the transmitter), it is good engineering practice to use a separate independent high level switch for emergency shut-down in critical applications.
2. When using a system with 2 or 4 set points on one probe, please keep in mind that these systems are designed for homogeneous liquids that do not change in their make-up or conductivity. If these conditions exist, please consider using 2 separate probes.
3. For multiple points on one probe, the fluid must be grounded to the mounting nipple. Special consideration should be taken for non-metallic tanks.
4. Applications with water based or electrically conductive liquids must have a Halar coated probe.
5. Material sticking on the probe will affect the repeatability of set points in multiple-point-on-one-probe applications. If such a condition is expected, please use one probe for each set-point.

2. THE LT 9000 IS DESIGNED TO BE USED IN ELECTRICALLY CONDUCTIVE LIQUIDS THAT DO NOT LEAVE A RESIDUE ON THE PROBE. A wet electrically conductive coating will give an indication of level at the highest point that there is a continuous coating from the surface of the fluid.
3. The LT 9000 will give a varying output, if the conductivity of the material changes.
4. For proper operation, the LT 9000 must be grounded to the fluid. In non-metallic tanks, extra grounding provisions may be necessary.
