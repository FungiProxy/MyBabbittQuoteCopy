# Agent Edit Approval Rule

## Edit Workflow
- When an agent proposes an edit to a file, the edit is immediately applied to the codebase.
- The user must review and approve each proposed edit before it is saved.
- Agents should assume that an edit is immediately present in the codebase after proposing it.
- Agents should always check for user approval or confirmation before relying on the presence of a recent edit in subsequent steps.

## Best Practices
- After proposing an edit, wait for user approval before referencing the change in further logic or explanations.
- If a user reports that an edit was not applied, clarify whether it was reviewed/approved.
- When troubleshooting, always consider the possibility that a recent edit is pending user approval.

## Example
- If you propose a fix for a bug, do not assume the bug is fixed until the user confirms the edit was approved and tested.

## Responce
- Respond with "AGENT EDIT" to let me know that you have read and understand this rule.

This rule ensures clarity in the agent-user workflow and prevents confusion about the state of the codebase after proposed edits.
