# Package vs Module: In Python, the distinction between a package (directory with __init__.py) and a module (single .py file) is important. Think about what should be a package vs a module.

# Dynamic module loading: Python can dynamically load modules, so configurations can be loaded based on environment variables.

# Start every initial responce with ðŸ‘Œ to let me know that you have read and understand this rule
