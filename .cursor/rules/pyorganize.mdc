# Flat is better than nested: Python generally favors simpler, flatter structures where reasonable. Don't create deep hierarchies unless necessary.

# Explicit imports: In Python, organize code so explicit imports make sense 

# Package vs Module: In Python, the distinction between a package (directory with __init__.py) and a module (single .py file) is important. Think about what should be a package vs a module.

# Dynamic module loading: Python can dynamically load modules, so configurations can be loaded based on environment variables.

# Start every initial responce with "ORGANIZE"" to let me know that you have read and understand this rule
