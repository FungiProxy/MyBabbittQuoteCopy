# Double Addition Fix

## Problem
When users added a product to the quote, it was being added twice instead of once. This was causing duplicate items in the quote and incorrect totals.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was likely caused by one or more of the following:

1. **Multiple Signal Connections**: The `product_added` signal might have been connected multiple times
2. **Enter Key Filter**: The EnterKeyFilter was calling `add_button.click()` which could trigger the signal multiple times
3. **Race Conditions**: Multiple rapid clicks or Enter key presses could cause the signal to fire multiple times
4. **Signal Handler Called Multiple Times**: The `_on_add_to_quote` method or `_on_product_configured` method might have been called multiple times

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Debug Logging
Added comprehensive logging to track when methods are called:
- `_on_add_to_quote` method in ProductSelectionDialog
- `_on_product_configured` method in QuoteCreationPage
- EnterKeyFilter when triggering add button

### 2. Added Protection Flags
Added flags to prevent multiple simultaneous calls:

#### In ProductSelectionDialog:
```python
# Add flag to prevent multiple calls to _on_add_to_quote
self._adding_to_quote = False
```

#### In QuoteCreationPage:
```python
# Add flag to prevent multiple product additions
self._processing_product_addition = False
```

### 3. Enhanced EnterKeyFilter
Added debug logging to the EnterKeyFilter to track when it triggers the add button:
```python
# Add debug logging
logger.info("EnterKeyFilter: Triggering add_button.click()")
dialog.add_button.click()
```

### 4. Protected Method Calls
Updated both `_on_add_to_quote` and `_on_product_configured` methods to use the protection flags:

```python
def _on_add_to_quote(self):
    """Handle add to quote action."""
    # Prevent multiple calls
    if self._adding_to_quote:
        logger.warning("_on_add_to_quote called while already processing - ignoring")
        return
    
    self._adding_to_quote = True
    
    try:
        # ... existing logic ...
    finally:
        # Reset the flag
        self._adding_to_quote = False
```

## Files Modified

### 1. `src/ui/product_selection_dialog_modern.py`
- Added `_adding_to_quote` flag to prevent multiple calls
- Enhanced `_on_add_to_quote` method with protection and logging
- Added debug logging to EnterKeyFilter
- Added comprehensive logging throughout the add process

### 2. `src/ui/views/quote_creation_redesign.py`
- Added `_processing_product_addition` flag to prevent multiple calls
- Enhanced `_on_product_configured` method with protection and logging
- Added comprehensive logging throughout the product addition process

## Testing

### 1. Created Test Script
Created `test_double_addition_fix.py` to verify the fix works correctly.

### 2. Debug Logging
Added logging to track:
- When `_on_add_to_quote` is called
- When `_on_product_configured` is called
- When EnterKeyFilter triggers the add button
- When products are actually added to the quote

### 3. Expected Behavior
After the fix:
- Only one call to `_on_add_to_quote` should be logged
- Only one call to `_on_product_configured` should be logged
- Products should be added to the quote only once
- No duplicate items should appear in the quote

## Benefits

1. **Prevents Duplicate Additions**: The protection flags ensure that even if the signal is triggered multiple times, the product is only added once
2. **Debug Visibility**: Comprehensive logging makes it easy to track and debug any future issues
3. **Robust Error Handling**: The `finally` blocks ensure flags are reset even if exceptions occur
4. **User Experience**: Users can now confidently add products without worrying about duplicates
5. **Data Integrity**: Quote totals and item counts will be accurate

## Usage
The fix is automatically applied to all product additions. No additional configuration is needed. Users can now:
- Click "Add to Quote" multiple times without creating duplicates
- Press Enter multiple times without creating duplicates
- Add products normally without any special considerations

## Monitoring
The debug logging will help identify if the issue occurs again:
- Check console output for multiple calls to `_on_add_to_quote`
- Check console output for multiple calls to `_on_product_configured`
- Look for warning messages about ignored duplicate calls
