"""
Service for managing customers.

This module provides a service layer for managing customers in Babbitt International's
quoting system. It implements business logic for:

- Customer creation and management
- Customer search and retrieval
- Customer data validation
- Customer relationship tracking
- Contact information management
- Customer-specific pricing rules

The service follows domain-driven design principles and separates business logic
from data access, providing a clean interface for customer management operations.

    Service class for managing customers in the quoting system.

    This service provides comprehensive customer management functionality including
    creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting customer records. It handles all
    customer-related business logic and data validation.

    The service handles:
    - Customer record management (CRUD operations)
    - Customer search and filtering
    - Contact information validation
    - Address management
    - Customer notes and metadata
    - Customer relationship tracking

    The service is implemented using static methods for simplicity and statelessness,
    making it easy to use across different parts of the application without
    managing instance state.

    Example:
        >>> db = SessionLocal()
        >>> # Create a new customer
        >>> customer = CustomerService.create_customer(
        ...     db,
        ...     name="Acme Industries",
        ...     email="contact@acme.com",
        ...     phone="555-0123"
        ... )
        >>>
        >>> # Retrieve and update customer
        >>> found = CustomerService.get_customer(db, customer.id)
        >>> updated = CustomerService.update_customer(
        ...     db,
        ...     customer.id,
        ...     {"address": "123 Main St", "city": "Springfield"}
        ... )
        >>>
        >>> # Search for customers
        >>> matches = CustomerService.search_customers(db, "Acme")
        >>>
        >>> # List all customers
        >>> all_customers = CustomerService.get_all_customers(db)
