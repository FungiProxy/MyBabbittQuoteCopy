"""
Product model for storing product information.

This module defines the Product model which represents the core product catalog
for Babbitt International. Each product entry contains basic information about
a product type, including its model number, description, pricing, and default
configuration options.

The Product model supports:
- Unique product identification
- Base pricing information
- Standard configurations
- Material and voltage options
- Categorization and searching

    """
    SQLAlchemy model representing a Babbitt International product.

    This model stores the fundamental product information and serves as the base
    for product configuration and pricing calculations. Each product has a unique
    model number and can be configured with different materials and voltages.

    Attributes:
        id (int): Primary key for the product
        model_number (str): Unique product model number (e.g., "LS2000", "LS8000/2")
        description (str): Detailed product description
        category (str): Product category for grouping (e.g., "Level Switch", "Transmitter")
        base_price (float): Starting price before material/length adjustments
        base_length (float): Standard length in inches for the product
        voltage (str): Default voltage configuration (e.g., "115VAC", "24VDC")
        material (str): Default material code:
                - "S": 316 Stainless Steel
                - "H": Halar Coated
                - "U": UHMWPE
                - "T": Teflon
        product_family_id (int): Foreign key to the product family this product belongs to

    Note:
        - Product variants (specific configurations) are handled by the ProductVariant model
        - Pricing calculations consider material-specific rules and length adjustments
        - The model_number field is indexed for efficient searching
        - Categories are indexed to support filtering and grouping

    Example:
        >>> product = Product(
        ...     model_number="LS2000-115VAC-S-10",
        ...     description="Level Switch, 10 inch, Stainless Steel",
        ...     category="Level Switch",
        ...     base_price=450.00,
        ...     base_length=10.0,
        ...     voltage="115VAC",
        ...     material="S",
        ...     product_family_id=1
        ... )
