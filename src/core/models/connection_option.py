"""
Connection option model for storing product connection configurations.

This module defines the ConnectionOption model for Babbitt International's quoting system.
It stores information about available connection types (flanges and tri-clamps) and their
pricing for different product families.

Supports:
- Flange connections (150# and 300# ratings)
- Tri-Clamp connections
- Size-specific pricing
- Product family compatibility

    SQLAlchemy model representing a product connection option.

    Stores information about connection types (flanges and tri-clamps), their sizes,
    ratings (for flanges), and pricing. Each connection option can be associated with
    multiple product families.

    Attributes:
        id (int): Primary key
        type (str): Connection type ("Flange" or "Tri-Clamp")
        rating (str): Pressure rating for flanges ("150#", "300#"), None for Tri-Clamp

        price (float): Additional cost for this connection option
        product_family_id (int): Foreign key to product family

    Example:
