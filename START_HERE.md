# Onboarding Checklist

Before starting work, every new agent or contributor must:

1. **Read [`README.md`](./README.md)** for project overview, setup, and usage instructions.
2. **Read [`ACTION_PLAN.md`](./ACTION_PLAN.md)** for the current prioritized action plan and next steps.
3. **Read [`project_notes.md`](./project_notes.md)** for design context, architectural decisions, and open questions.
4. **Confirm you understand:**
   - The current project state and priorities
   - Where to find main code, tests, and documentation
   - How to run and test the project
5. **If you have questions,** add them to `project_notes.md` or ask the project lead.
