## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. **Incremental Development**: Building features one at a time
2. **Testing Early**: Creating test applications to validate features
3. **Simplification**: Removing complex features that weren't working
4. **Focus on Core Functionality**: Theme, scaling, and basic animations

### What Didn't Work
1. **Over-engineering**: Complex accessibility system was too ambitious
2. **Animation Complexity**: Some animations caused UI corruption
3. **Feature Creep**: Adding too many features at once

### Best Practices Established
1. **Test Everything**: Each feature has a working demo
2. **Keep It Simple**: Focus on working features over complex ones
3. **Incremental Integration**: Build features that can be easily integrated
4. **Documentation**: Clear documentation of what works and what doesn't

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 9: Advanced Features (Optional)
- Advanced data visualization components
- Drag-and-drop interfaces
- Real-time collaboration features
- Advanced search and filtering
- Export/import with modern interfaces

### Maintenance
