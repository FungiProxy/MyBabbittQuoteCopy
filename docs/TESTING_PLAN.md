## Test Implementation

### Unit Tests
```python
# Example test structure
def test_model_creation():
    """Test model creation and validation."""
    pass

def test_service_functionality():
    """Test service methods and error handling."""
    pass

def test_integration_workflow():
    """Test complete workflow from start to finish."""
    pass
```
